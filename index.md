### Game Objective - HOW DO I WIN?!:

_Space Harrier Tribute_ is a project that shows an approach of the original Space Harrier game programmed only using C++ and the SDL Library.
In this project, different techniques will be used in order to recreate the original game without using the chips that the original developers had to use.
All the resources (sprites, SFX and music) of the game where ripped using Gens KMOD emulator (http://gendev.spritesmind.net/page-gensK.html) or entirely by hand, trying to mimic on a
maximum level the original game.
In the website of _Space Harrier Tribute_ you will find detailed information on how to play, videos of the tribute and extra information about the original game.

Grab your jetpack and your handcannon, fasten your seatbelts and WELCOME TO THE FANTASY ZONE!
